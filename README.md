Symph list

This repo will track lists of symphs that can be fed to Signals to automatically add new symphs aswell as refersh existing symfs that are modified.

The symphony_tracker file will be updated with new or any symphony that any user like to include in signals list. This will require some level of collaborative to maintain this file so it will be open to public to edit in beginning ans if needed restrit to few users to update it in future depending on how we progress.

The format i plan to use to update the tracker is as below
Symphony_Link|Short_Name|Original_SymfLink|Long_Form_Name

Symphony_Link : A statuc copy of the original Symph. User can make a local copy and share that link. This link is not expected to be modified 
Short_Name : A short name of 10-15 characters where ending/suffix is expected to be date numbers of format YYMMDD
Original_SymfLink : Is the link to original symf from which the static copy was made
Long_FormName : Is a not very long Name that relates to name of original symf, special characters should be avoided.
